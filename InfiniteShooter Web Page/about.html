                    InfinteShooter... was originally a game programmed in HTML? Canvas2D was <i>awesome</i> (but nobody used it). And I had no idea what Git was.
                    So needless to say I lost the USB containing all of InfiniteShooter's files, and it was lost forever. Once I was given the option to make a
                    game for Computer Science, I knew what I was going to do! I was to recreate InfiniteShooter from memory (with quite a bit of extra tweaks).
                    This is that game!

                    InfiniteShooter is a simple arcade game. Models are made in Blender and I'm trying to make the graphics a as best as possible without sacrificing
                    performance. You play as a simple blue ship trying to defeat hordes of black and red ships. [NOTE: This game used to have a bit of a story! Maybe I
                    should reintroduce it in future updates?] Now anyway, the goal of the game is to be like a rougelike game, but for a shooter, and the player should
                    be able to... infinitely play. Hence the name. Once the game is submitted I'm planning on releasing it on GitHub as FLOSS (if I'm allowed to).

                    I program stuff. I don't think there's any more to me than that. Egghead Productions is what I'm making this game under. Hopefully a company?
                    Something of the like? I don't know. So far it's just myself and <a href="https://github.com/Egghead69">Acoy Campbell</a> working at Egghead Productions.
