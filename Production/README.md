InfiniteShooter "Production" files
==================================
This contains all the files required to create packages for InfiniteShooter. I am currently working on Linux packages (that is, a PKGBUILD for Arch Linux and RPM stuff for Fedora systems) but may probably work on an installation wizard for Windows in the future. Good news is we won't need this if (when?) I move InfiniteShooter to Steam.  
  
The main reason for having this though was because Godot _exports_ InfiniteShooter, but doesn't make it "deployable" as an installable program on other systems.
