# Wait! I thought InfiniteShooter was written in PyGame!
To sum it up:  
a) the PyGame port suffered from a _lot_ of bugs  
b) I wasn't using standard conventions which made programming a lot harder than usual  
c) I was learning the Godot engine and thought remaking InfiniteShooter would be a good place to start-turns out I made a port that has no bugs (I hope), is rendered in real-time with OpenGL, and has a lot of new fancy effects! And an options menu! AND controller support!  
I had a very messy transition between branches to make this the default branch but I can assure you that I won't be switching engines any time soon. And besides, you can always contribute to the PyGame version as it was in the branch aptly named `pygame`.

# Installation
Not currently installable! I will fix this before I release InfiniteShooter 2.0

# Uninstallation

Not currently uninstallable!

# Hardware/software requirements

**Minimum hardware**: I tested this generally on an Intel Pentium processor. Unfortunately, since I don't know which, I can only garuntee that it works within this range. I'm guessing since there are many performance optimizations and that there is no heavy rendering going on that you can run this on any Pentium, but beware.  
**Tested hardware**: AMD Ryzen 5 3500U with mobile graphics (Lenovo ThinkPad E595)  
**Recommended hardware**: The very best you can muster. I don't know, RTX or something. But there's a GPU shortage right now so yeah.  
**Recommended OS**: GNU/Linux  
**Tested OS**: Fedora 34

# Contributing
You actually want to contribute to InfiniteShooter? It'll be great to have you!  
Only thing is I only have experience to create repositories to store my software and I've never had any experience with contributing with others!  
If you have any idea on how this works, please contact me (my address is somewhere in my GitHub profile) and let me know!

# Trivia
This game was my final project for my Computing Science 10 class! The first ever version (before 1.0) was made ~June of 2021 and since then the game's received a lot of improvements.  
But expect more changes to come! You can see my port of InfiniteShooter to the Godot engine in the `godotengine-port` branch.

## Roadmap for the future
- [ ] Improve gameplay (somehow)
- [ ] Release on Steam, possibly using: https://gramps.github.io/GodotSteam
    - [ ] Achievements handled on Steam's server side (no in-game menu makes programming easier)
    - [ ] Up to 4 person multiplayer
