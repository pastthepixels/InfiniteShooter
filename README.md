InfiniteShooter Godot Port
==========================

A "port" of InfiniteShooter to the Godot engine because I want to have some experience with making games in this engine. If finished, this game will:
- have way less bugs compared to the game
- have the ability to be exported to almost all platforms
- have better controller support
- render everything in real-time with OpenGL (and hopefully with Godot 4.0 Vulkan)
- be developed on further to get better gameplay mechanics
- be the successor to InfiniteShooter; InfiniteShooter (version) 2.0

The repository should also then just have the original README copied over and modified slightly.  
* I also have to move the `models` folder as well.
