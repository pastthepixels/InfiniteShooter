InfiniteShooter scenes
======================

## Base path
- Anything that is standalone (creating a folder for it will result in only it being in the folder)

## Effects
- Explosions
- Screen shaking

## Enemies
- All enemy models
	- They're in different scenes because each model has a custom collision object tailored to its size.
- The wrapper for these models (Enemy.tscn)

## UI
- Anything to do with the game's UI; health bars, in-game HUD, pausing screens, main menu screens, and more.
